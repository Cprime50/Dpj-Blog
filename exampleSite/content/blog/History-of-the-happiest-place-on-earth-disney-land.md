#### The History of the Happiest Place on Earth
Disneyland is an iconic amusement park located in Anaheim, California. It was founded by Walt Disney, the creator of beloved characters including Mickey Mouse, and animated films like Snow White. It officially opened in 1955.

Since its creation more than 60 years ago. The South Californian Park has been known to be the happiest place on earth. Disneyland has become a symbol of American popular culture with its enchanting rides, captivating shows, and enchanting atmosphere.

The idea for Disneyland began when Walt Disney visited a park in Los Angeles with his daughters Diane and Sharon Disney. He sat on a bench watching them ride a merry-go-round, he felt that there should be a park where both parents and kids could have fun together instead of parents just having to watch their kids. In his own words, he said:


> The idea for Disneyland came about when my daughters were very young and Saturday was always Daddy’s day with the two daughters. . . and as I’d sit on a bench while they rode the merry-go-round . . . I felt that there should be something built where the parents and the children could have fun together. So that’s how Disneyland started. It all started from a daddy with two daughters wondering where he could take them and where he could have a little fun with them, too

In 1948, Walt Disney embarked on his ambitious plan by sending a memo to studio production designer Dick Kelsey, outlining his vision for "Mickey Mouse Park" - a more family-friendly destination. Responding to numerous fan letters expressing their desire for a visitable Disney Studio, Disney concluded that a functional movie studio held limited appeal for visitors. Instead, he conceived a concept for a small park, encompassing a boat ride and themed attractions, to be situated on an eight-acre (3.2 ha) plot located south of the Disney studio.

 

However, as the project evolved, the proposed location proved insufficient, prompting Walt Disney to seek inspiration from other parks. Visiting renowned destinations like the Tivoli Gardens park in Denmark, Knott's Berry Farm, Colonial Williamsburg, the Century of Progress in Chicago, and the New York World's Fair of 1939, Disney's ideas began to expand and flourish. Consequently, he acquired an additional 160 acres (65 ha) of orange groves and walnut trees in Anaheim, situated southeast of Los Angeles in Orange County.

 

With this new acquisition, the project grew far beyond Disney's initial expectations, necessitating the recruitment of more designers and leading to the creation of something bigger and better than he had ever envisioned.


Disney had gone through some difficulties in obtaining funds for building the park. In response to funding difficulties. To raise funds, Disney partnered with ABC and created a television show called Disneyland. In exchange, ABC agreed to provide financial support for the park. Initially, Disneyland was owned by Disneyland, Inc., jointly owned by Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney himself, Western Publishing, and ABC. To generate additional revenue, Disney also rented out shops on Main Street, U.S.A. to external companies. In 1960, Walt Disney Productions bought out all other shares, solidifying their ownership. The partnership with ABC continued to grow and eventually led to the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of ABC in the mid-1990s. Construction of Disneyland began on July 16, 1954, and cost $17 million to complete. The park opened exactly one year and one day later.


#### The Opening Day

Disneylands opening day in 1955 was plagued with numerous challenges. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland welcomed visitors for the first time, offering 18 rides and attractions spread across five themed lands: Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, and Main Street USA.

The park had only opened for a preview day with invited guests and the press, before the public opening on the following day. However, the preview day turned into a disaster. The dedication ceremonies, featuring prominent figures such as Governor Goodwin Knight and Walt Disney's Hollywood friends Ronald Reagan, Art Link letter, and Robert Cummings, were broadcast live on ABC to an audience of over 90 million viewers. Despite the anticipation, the day quickly earned the nickname "Black Sunday" and Disneyland was deemed "Walt's Folly" by the press.

Everything seemed to go wrong on that day. The scorching weather reached 101 degrees Fahrenheit. More than half of the attendees had managed to enter the park without proper invitations, either through counterfeit tickets or by jumping over the fence. The freshly-poured asphalt caused women's heels to sink. Due to a plumbers' strike, Disney had to choose between functioning toilets or drinking fountains, and he opted for the former.

Traffic was at a standstill on the newly-constructed freeway, causing delays for celebrity guests like Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. Adding to the troubles, a gas leak forced the closure of three out of the five themed lands shortly after the park opened.

Nonetheless, Walt Disney remained optimistic and delivered his official dedication, expressing his vision of Disneyland as a place where people could relive cherished memories and embrace the challenges and dreams of the future. Despite the difficulties of that opening day, Disneyland would go on to become a source of joy and inspiration for people worldwide.
