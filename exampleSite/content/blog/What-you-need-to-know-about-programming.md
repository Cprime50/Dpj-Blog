Have you ever been enticed by promises of mastering programming within a few weeks or months? It's a common claim in the digital age, where everything seems possible at lightning speed. However, the reality is quite different. Programming isn't an overnight success story – it's a journey that demands time, dedication, and consistent effort.

As someone who once saw programming through rose-tinted glasses, I can relate to the initial allure. Like many aspiring developers, my journey began with the dream of creating my own games. I thought, "How hard could it be? After all, I just want to make games!" But reality had a different lesson in store.


#### Learning to program
Learning to program can be challenging, and you might come across ads or content promising quick mastery in just weeks or months. But the truth is, programming isn't that simple. It takes considerable time and dedication to grasp the concepts, and there's a lot of context to understand. Even experienced programmers continue learning daily, reflecting the ever-evolving nature of the field. However, there's no reason to lose hope. In fact, perseverance is key to excelling in programming. Learning occurs through experience and the time spent practicing.

For beginners, it's natural to wonder about the journey ahead and what it's like to move from being a beginner to an intermediate programmer. Experiences differ from person to person, and you're free to choose your unique path. 

> Programming is the art of turning imagination into reality, one line of code at a time.

#### The Reality Check
Programming is like a puzzle that requires meticulous problem-solving. It involves understanding not only the programming languages but also the logic and context behind them. Even experienced programmers find themselves in a perpetual learning loop, as the tech world evolves faster than ever.

But don't be disheartened – there's a silver lining. The key to mastering programming lies in perseverance. Each line of code you write is a step toward building something incredible. With each challenge, you learn and grow, shaping your skills in ways you never imagined.


#### Start from the basics
If you're new to programming the best way to start is from the “basics”. It is the first step of becoming a good programmer. Starting from scratch might not sound as glamorous as diving into complex projects, but it's vital. Just as you wouldn't build a sky-high tower without a solid foundation, programming demands understanding the basics. Think of it as laying the groundwork for your coding journey.

To get this right, you need to learn the core of computer science, lucky for us  there are tons of resources on the internet to help with this. All you need to do is search through them, and start with one that the best fits you.
Here are some resources below that can help you get started.

#### Learning takes time
Patience is very important if you want to be a succesful programmer. Alot of times there will be drawbacks, there will be situations that will be very fustrating you ksut want to give up, but you have to be able to bounce back and not give up in those situations, taking this step will enable you push through complex problems you face, and you learn more and become better after every problem solved.

#### Be Prepared for Problem-Solving

I assume this is on the list of reasons why you want to become a programmer beacuse programming is, at its core, about solving problems. Whether it's debugging code, optimizing performance, or troubleshooting errors, a significant portion of your programming journey will involve critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

#### Set Goals and Level Up:

Programming can be like a video game where you need goals to keep leveling up. If you're learning C++ for example, set a goal to make a simple project every week, it doesnt have to be big, just a small command line calculator, a tic tac toe game, be creative and make something with whatever new thing you learn. I like to imagine buiding something like a game whenever learning a new concept, you can build a game out of almost any thing. Once your goal is set in mind, write it down on a paper, the work towards achieving it, then set another goal, Overtime of doing this it becomes so much more easier. As you learn, aim for bigger challenges. 

#### Do More, Learn More:
Remember, programming is all about problem-solving, not just learning syntax. You want to use your coding tools to solve real-world problems. The more projects you tackle, the better you become at solving problems.

Being creative is crucial. Think of projects that interest you. Don't worry if ideas don't pop up right away, explore GitHub, create an account, find inspiration from other repositorys and post your repositorys too once you completed your project.

#### The Never-Ending Journey
Crossed the beginners' level? Great! But don't stop there. Programming is like a never-ending game, there's always something more to explore. Once done with the basics you should explore a few other concepts such as, 
1. Learning algorithms: Algoritms are really important part of solving a problem, you should aim at solving a problem everyday using different algorithms, this can also help you land your first job as most job interviews are based on using algorithms to solve problem.

2. Embrace Tools: Imagine you're a carpenter with a toolbox. Programming's the same. Tools make your job easier. [Git](https://git-scm.com/), code editors, frameworks. They help you work faster and focus on the real challenges.

3. Google is your friend: Often times you may face challenges that seem unsolvable or you're simply just lost, well their are certain helpful places for programmers to get help, such as [Google](http://Google.com) , [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

3. Read Documentation: This is very important, often times you can't know everything about a tool you're using. You need to read the docs to understand how it works, what it can do, and how to use it effectively.
Documentation is like a user manual in the programming world. It's packed with valuable information that can save you time, prevent errors, and help you make the most out of the tools at your disposal.
When you encounter a new programming language, framework, or library, take the time to dive into its documentation. It might seem overwhelming at first, but eventually you'll find it to be very useful, if you feel you dont understand something in the docs, copy and paste on [google](http://google.com) or this little ai freind [chatgpt](http://chat.openai.com).

#### Summary
Rremember that programming is a journey, not a destination. It's an adventure filled with challenges, discoveries, and, most importantly, growth. As someone who also had it really rough at first, I can assure you that while it might not be as easy as you initially thought, the journey is undoubtedly worth it. So, grab your keyboard, summon your curiosity, and dive into the world of programming. Your creations await!
