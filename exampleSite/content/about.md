Welcome to my blog, I started this platform to document my journey into software development, the cloud, Open source and linux. 


#### Technologies I use
Go, C# & .NET, Typescript & React, AWS & GCP, gRPC & REST, linux,
Ebiten & Monogames.


### My Distinct Focus

I've always had a passion for in-depth exploration of different technologies. I hope to share detailed tutorials, articles, and resources focused on these technologies.


Thank you for reading.
