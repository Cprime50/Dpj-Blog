### How I started
I'm Charles, been prgramming for about 3 years now, it all started with a love for games as it would be for a lot of other devs, started out doing some gamedev stuff which I was really passionate about. I got into web dev a while after, learing python and flask, then I found Go and its been my favorite choice ever since, anyways these langauges are just tools meant to solve a problem so I'm not just hung up to Go, I also write typescript with nestjs for infastructures and Vuejs for Front end stuff I have to do.

### University
In university, I pursued computer science because I wanted to learn more about programming, and so far it's been an amazing experience, I can say that I have learnt so much. I also met some really talented peers, who helped improve my skills and knowledge by alot.

### My Hobbys
Although I spend most of my time doing Web dev stuff, I like to explore other parts of programming, like low-level messing around with C, and game dev. I also find it interesting reading up articles online which is why I started this blog.
